# ARMDSL - a prototype ARM template builder

This project is a prototype for a new way to build ARM templates for Azure using JavaScript. TypeScript type definitions provide excellent tooling VSCode without the need for extensions.

This is very much a prototype, so expect many rough edges.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/bterlson/armdsl`.
2. Install dependencies: `cd armdsl && npm install`.
3. Run armdsl scripts with `npx` and `ts-node`: `npx ts-node samples/basic.ts`
